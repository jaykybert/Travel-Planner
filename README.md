# TravelPlanner

This project was an assignment for my first year programming course at university.
The assignment was to produce a travel planner.

My travel planner contains three main features, each on a seperate webpage.
The first feature allows the user to see the weather for a location of their choosing, and change various display settings.
The second feature prompts you to enter a start and finish location and displays the steps of the journey.
The final feature asks the user for a location name and a 'keyword' describing a type of place. It then displays results
relevant to the location and type of place which can be sorted in several ways.

In order for the requests to work, they need API keys.
In each of the logic.py files, an empty-string variable named api_key should be replaced with the actual API key.
